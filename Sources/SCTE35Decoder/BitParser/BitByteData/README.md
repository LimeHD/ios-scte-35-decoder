#  BitByteData
Code in this directory has been lifted directly from https://github.com/tsolomko/BitByteData/releases/tag/1.4.3.

The project does not support Carthage as of 1.4.3, and so a decision has been taken to (perhaps temporarily) copy the code over. I have included the MIT LICENCE, and have also only copied over the parts of the code that I have actually used in this project.
